### Handling URLs and Anchors in Pasted HyperText
* Only retain the anchors and text
* The anchors, and valid URLs within the text will be converted into plain anchors.

### Handling input text
* It can process the input text and dynamically convert valid URLs within the text into plain anchors.

* When deleting text within an anchor
	* If it is a diff-anchor, it will not take any action until all the text within the anchor is deleted, at which point the anchor itself will be removed.
	* For a same-anchor, if the remaining anchor text is still a valid URL after deletion, the href will be updated to match the text. Otherwise, the anchor will be converted into plain text.

* When converting between text and anchors, it must maintain the cursor position.
