## <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
AutolinkEditor is a lightweight and simple text editor inspired by a specific requirement in a project. It automatically converts rich text pasted into the editor into plain text with the format of editor, and also automatically detects URLs in both pasted and manually entered text, converting them into anchor tags.
